AVERT is an EPA tool which

avertr is very much still under development. It is also the first R package I've developed and the biggest software project I've undertaken. All of that is to say: set your expectations low and you'll be pleasantly surprised. I'm working on making it more user-friendly.

Why use avertr?

-   It's easy to integrate into R code.

-   It's faster than AVERT's Main Module and (seemingly, often) faster than the Web Version.

-   It's more easily modifiable.

-   Working with avertr can help you get a better understanding of how AVERT works (especially if you're more familiar with R than VBA).

**NOTE**: avertr is based on EPA's AVERT, but it is completely independent. I do not work for the EPA.

## Installation

You can install the development version of avertr from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("pak")
pak::pak("josephpendleton/avertr")
```

## Requirements

Files are big. You need 16 GB. Haven't yet tested on Windows.

## Set Up

The current version of avertr requires some manual setup by the user. Hop

## Example

This is a basic example which shows you how to solve a common problem:

```{r example}
library(avertr)
## basic example code
```

What is special about using `README.Rmd` instead of just `README.md`? You can include R chunks like so:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

You'll still need to render `README.Rmd` regularly, to keep `README.md` up-to-date. `devtools::build_readme()` is handy for this.

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo = FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

In that case, don't forget to commit and push the resulting figure files, so they display on GitHub and CRAN.
